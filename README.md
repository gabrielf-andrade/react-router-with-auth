- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Enhanced performance and SEO with server-rendered content.
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Fast and efficient development experience.
- **Asset Bundling & Optimization**: Optimized builds for production deployment.
- **Data Loading & Mutations**: Streamlined data handling with React Router's data APIs.
- **TypeScript**: Fully typed codebase for improved maintainability and developer experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent styling.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js (v18 or higher) and npm/pnpm installed.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable) or download the template.**
2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    # or npm install
    ```

### Development Server

Start the development server with hot module replacement:

```bash
pnpm run dev
# or npm run dev
```

Your application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── app/                  # Main application source code
│   ├── components/       # Reusable UI components (Auth, Layout, UI elements)
│   ├── lib/              # Utility functions, API services, session management
│   ├── routes/           # React Router route components and layouts
│   └── ...
├── public/               # Static assets
├── schemas/              # Validation schemas (e.g., for sign-in/sign-up)
├── react-router.config.ts # React Router configuration
├── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration
├── vite.config.ts        # Vite build configuration
└── ...
```

## Building for Production

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
pnpm run build
# or npm run build
```

The build output will be located in the `build/` directory.

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

For containerized deployments, use the provided `Dockerfile`:

1.  **Build the Docker image:**

    ```bash
    docker build -t my-react-app .
    ```

2.  **Run the container:**

    ```bash
    docker run -p 3000:3000 my-react-app
    ```

This containerized application can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker, such as AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, Azure Container Apps, Digital Ocean App Platform, Fly.io, or Railway.

### Manual Deployment (DIY)

If you prefer a manual deployment, the built-in app server is production-ready. Ensure you deploy the contents of the `build/` directory.

The essential files for deployment are:

```
├── package.json
├── pnpm-lock.yaml (or package-lock.json, or bun.lockb)
├── build/
│   ├── client/    # Static assets (JS, CSS, images)
│   └── server/    # Server-side code
```

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) pre-configured for a streamlined styling experience. You are free to use any other CSS framework or approach you prefer.
